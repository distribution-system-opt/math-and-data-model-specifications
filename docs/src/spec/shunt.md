# Shunts

A **shunt** is a fixed admittance connected between a set of bus terminals (and,
implicitly, ground). Grounding impedances should be modelled as a shunt.
Symbols are defined in [Notation](notation.md).

## 1. Data model

A shunt is an entry of the top-level `shunt` object, keyed by its string ID $h$.

| Field | Type | Unit | Req. | Description |
|-------|------|:----:|:----:|-------------|
| `bus` | string | – | ✔ | Host bus ID $i$ |
| `terminal_map` | string[] | – | ✔ | Conductor→terminal map $\textcolor{purple}{\mathbf{N}_{h}}$ |
| `G_k_j` | number | S | ✔ (`G_1_1`) | Conductance matrix entries |
| `B_k_j` | number | S | ✔ (`B_1_1`) | Susceptance matrix entries |

## 2. Input symbols

| Field | Symbol | Notes |
|-------|:------:|-------|
| `G_k_j`, `B_k_j` | $\textcolor{brown}{\mathbf{Y}_{h}} = \mathbf{G} + \textcolor{brown}{j}\mathbf{B}$ | admittance matrix (S), row-first entries |

The matrix is stored row-first: entry $(k,j)$ is field `G_k_j` / `B_k_j`. Ground is
never indexed (its voltage is zero).

**Suggestion:** define the `terminal_map` only for the necessary
terminals to avoid zero-padded matrices and a more compact representation.

## 3. Variables

**None.** A shunt introduces no unknown — its current is determined entirely by the
bus voltage and its fixed admittance.

## 4. Equality constraints

The current drawn into the shunt at its terminals is linear in the bus voltage:

```math
\textcolor{blue}{\mathbf{I}_{h}} = \textcolor{brown}{\mathbf{Y}_{h}}\,\textcolor{blue}{\mathbf{U}_i}[\textcolor{purple}{\mathbf{N}_{h}}].
```

This current is the shunt's contribution to KCL at bus $i$ (leaving the bus toward
the admittance/ground). Examples: a single-entry $\textcolor{brown}{Y_{h,nn}}$ on
terminal $n$ grounds the neutral through an impedance.

## 5. Inequality constraints

**None.**
